# Notes

* I'm removing the "Class dismissed!" tone; people are able to engage with this content at their own pace; "dismissing" them could encourage them to stop instead of continuing.
* The form structure for Lesson 1 isn't ideal; the "List" field would be better for enumerating the items you're brining, and the Paragraph field \(maybe styled to be small\) would be a more appropriate size for a fun fact. And there's no checkbox for whether the person's coming \(or radio input for "Yes, coming", "No, not coming", and "Unsure"\); updating the RSVP would be a good example of editing an entry.
* The screenshots lack some context. Zooming out a bit to show the field groups on the right and the form layout on the left I think would help give a sense of space.
