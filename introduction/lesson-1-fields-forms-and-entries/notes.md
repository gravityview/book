# Notes

* We should add a paragraph saying that GV uses GF for forms, since below it mentions that GF and GV work together. GF hasn't been "introduced" yet.
* I'm removing the "Class dismissed!" tone; people are able to engage with this content at their own pace; "dismissing" them could encourage them to stop instead of continuing.
* The form structure for Lesson 1 isn't ideal; the "List" field would be better for enumerating the items you're brining, and the Paragraph field \(maybe styled to be small\) would be a more appropriate size for a fun fact. And there's no checkbox for whether the person's coming \(or radio input for "Yes, coming", "No, not coming", and "Unsure"\); updating the RSVP would be a good example of editing an entry.
* The screenshots lack some context. Zooming out a bit to show the field groups on the right and the form layout on the left I think would help give a sense of space.

### Todo

* [ ] Add a paragraph introducing GF
* [ ] Update the RSVP form
* [ ] Update field groups section with screenshot showing context
