# DIY Layout

## DIY makes it possible to create layouts with completely custom HTML, without touching code.

DIY is a different kind of View layout: the purpose is to allow **designers and developers** the most flexibility.

The goals of the layout are to:

* Reduce the amount of PHP programming needed
* Configure your View outside of the Custom Content field
* Maintain the visual nature of GravityView field layouts
* Add _tons_ of flexibility to layouts
  * Make it easy to wrap fields in different HTML tags
  * Customize using CSS as much as you want, without more code than is necessary
  * Less opinionated markup

DIY allows you to use your own CSS and HTML structure instead of needing to modify our predefined layouts to fit your needs.

### New field settings allow you to add custom HTML before or after field values

The Before Output and After Output textareas allow you to add content before and after the field value. Without DIY, you would need to either use filters to modify the field output, or use a Custom Content field.

* Use shortcodes, including `[gvlogic]` 
* Supports Merge Tags
* **The DIY layout has no Field Labels**‚Äîyou can add your own here

### Choose your own container tag

Easily wrap field values in different tags, to build a layout of fields.
