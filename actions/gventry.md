Let's try to show each method in \GV\Entry using GitBook's…um…method.

{% method %}
## by_id( $entry_id )

* `@param int|string $entry_id The internal entry ID.`

Construct a `\GV\Entry` instance by ID.

Whatever language you are using, the result will be the same.

```php
$ My first method
```

{% endmethod %}
