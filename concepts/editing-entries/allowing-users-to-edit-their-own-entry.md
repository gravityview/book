## Add an "Edit Entry" link

Click "Add Field", scroll down and click "Edit Entry". This inserts a link to edit the entry that will **only be visible to users who are able to edit the entry**. Site visitors who are logged-out or logged-in users who did not create the entry will not see the link.

## Now you've enabled User Edit!

* When an user is logged-out, they will not see the Edit Entry links
* When an user is logged-in, they will see links to edit only the entries they created
* Administrators are able to edit all entries
  * Any user who can edit entries inside Gravity Forms will be able to edit entries
  * If you want to limit this capability, use the [Members plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/members/) to limit each user's "gravityforms\_edit\_entries" capability
