# The Search Bar

## Configuring the Search Bar

GravityView's Search Bar allows for some great configuration options.

## Click "Add Widget" button

**If you're creating a new View,** you will need to Start Fresh or choose a Data Source before you are able to see the Add Widget button.

## This is what the search bar settings looks like

The **Search Layout** setting toggles between showing fields side-by-side ("**Horizontal**") or stacked on top of another ("**Vertical**")

The "Show Clear button" adds an option to reset the search results. [Read more about the Clear button here](http://docs.gravityview.co/article/178-using-the-search-bar-clear-button).

By default, there's one search field: "Search Everything". It does what it says.

## Then click the drop-down that was just added under Search Field

You can select from any search field in your current form. Here, we are adding a search field for the "Job Title" field. This will search just the Job Title for entries.

## A new "Search Mode" setting will appear

When you have multiple search fields, you'll be presented with a Search Mode setting: do you want *all* the search fields to be matched for an entry to be displayed, or do you want to show an entry if *any* of the fields are matched?

## You can change the label of a search field by modifying the "Label" value

If left blank, the default value will be used. The default values are shown in light grey.

If you don't want to display a label for the search field, insert a blank space.

## Some fields will allow different input types

If you have multiple-choice field in your form, for example, you will be able to choose from different ways of displaying the search field.
