## Add content or HTML to the text field.

You can add shortcodes, including the Gravity Forms shortcode to embed a form.

In this example, we have placeolders for the date the entry was submitted, and we are using the [[gvlogic] shortcode](http://docs.gravityview.co/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode) to show the submitted First and Last Name contents, if they exist.

### How the code example outputs:

You can see that the Merge Tags were replaced with entry values and the HTML was processed properly.

## Additional Code Examples

Lots of things are possible with the Custom Content field. Here are some more options:

### If you want to display the entire entry submission, as shown in the Gravity Forms View Entry screen, use the {all_fields} Merge Tag.
